OSPAR request to generate swept area and abundance index outputs

The request is divided in two main parts:

The component 1 aims to define swept area estimates for all DATRAS hauls. To do this, in WKABSENS they developed the swept_area_modelling.R script. This script takes 

  - 1st estimates in DATRAS flexfiles (with algorithms updated during WKSAE 2021)
  
  - For the remaining missing values, takes swept area estimates as calculated by OSPAR, scripts in Moriarty_Kelly_updates 
  
  - Those hauls with still no swept area estimates will be filled with linear regression using all data available.
  
The component 2...

The final data products are downloadable here (link)

All data necessary to run this scripts including the specific DATRAS downloads used are available as Data outputs with DOIÂ´s this and that, available here (link)

Any comments, questions etc to be directed to advice@ices.dk (?)
