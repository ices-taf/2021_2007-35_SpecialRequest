OSPAR request to generate swept area and abundance index outputs for all otter and beam trawl surveys in the Northeast Atlantic and regional seas based on DATRAS data as input to OSPAR common indicator 
<br>
<br>


The request is divided in two main parts:

 - Component 1: Swept area estimates for all hauls in the DATRAS data base
 
 - Component 2: Annual estimates of abundance of all species identified as sensitive in the current list from WGBIODIV 2020.
<br>

The complete ICES advice document answering the request can be found in:

https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.8281
