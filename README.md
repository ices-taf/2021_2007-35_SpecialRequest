OSPAR request to generate swept area and abundance index outputs for all otter and beam trawl surveys in the Northeast Atlantic and regional seas based on DATRAS data as input to OSPAR common indicator 
<br>
<br>


The request is divided in two main parts:

 - Component 1: Swept area estimates for all hauls in the DATRAS data base
 
 - Component 2: Annual estimates of abundance of all species identified as sensitive in the current list from WGBIODIV 2020.
<br>

The complete ICES advice document answering the request can be found in:

* ICES.2021. OSPAR request to generate swept area and abundance index outputs for all otter and beam trawl surveys in the Northeast Atlantic and regional seas based on DATRAS data as input to OSPAR common indicator. ICES Advice. sr.2007.35.
https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.8300
<br>

Input data required to run the scripts are available in the ICES library in the following Data outputs, :

* Data for the OSPAR request to generate swept area and abundance index outputs (https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Forms/DispForm.aspx?ID=37999)
https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.data.8287

The final data products, SweptAreaAssessmentOutput and SensitiveSpeciesAbundanceIndices, are available for download from DATRAS web:

The scripts in this repo have been created and edited by two working groups:

* WKSAE-DATRAS, Workshop on the production of swept area estimates for all hauls in DATRAS for biodiversity assessments.
